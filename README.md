# FastAPI Sample App

This is a sample FastAPI application that demonstrates how to create a FastAPI web service. This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Docker ([Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started))

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-sample-app.git
cd fastapi-sample-app
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

You can create a Python virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. If you prefer not to use a virtual environment, you can skip this step.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
On Windows:
```

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Before running the FastAPI app, you'll need to set up the necessary environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project directory. You can use the provided `example.env` as a template. Copy and rename it to `.env`, then edit it to include your specific configuration.

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include the required values for your application.

Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db

# SMTP server configuration for sending emails
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password

# FastAPI app settings
FASTAPI_ENV=development
DEBUG=True
```

Make sure to replace the example values with your actual configuration settings.

### Running the App

#### Using Docker

You can run the app in a Docker container. Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t fastapi-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
```

The FastAPI app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

#### Running Directly

Alternatively, you can run the app directly with Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

The FastAPI app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

You can interact with the FastAPI app by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser or using API testing tools like [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/docs) or [ReDoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc). The app provides various endpoints that you can explore and test.
